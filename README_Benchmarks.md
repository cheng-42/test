fpga_flow is a folder which contains benchmarks testing the performances of the tool on a known variety of benchmarks. In order to launch them, a script called run_fpga_spice_testbench_study.sh is called. This script is based on different other scripts which can be found in the script folder.

The different benchmarks can be found in the fpga_spice_bench.txt found in the benchmarks folder. By commenting them, the script will not read them and not run through them. This can be useful if you want to focus on one benchmark in particular for example.
